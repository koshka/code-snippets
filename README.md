### Basic HTML template

Without a `viewport` meta tag, mobile devices render pages at typical desktop screen widths, and then scale the pages to fit the mobile screens. Setting the `viewport` enables you to control the width and scaling of the viewport. 

The `width=device-width` key-value pair sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device. The `initial-scale=1` key-value pair sets the initial zoom level when visiting the page.
